Project description:


Project planning (lay out your process through the data science pipeline)
1. Acquire data, clean data
2. Explore and deal with outliers
3. Split data
4. Explore data on unscaled train set 
    -train_scaled , train_unscaled
    -Cluster on scaled data
        -density, volatile acidity, and alcohol
        -add clusters to X_train, X_val, and X_test
5. Create questions and visuals and statistical tests
6. Model using classification
    -Feature selection (recurvsive, etc.)
7. Create final notebook

Initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas
1. The proportion of acid to (alcohol + sugar) affects quality
2. White and red wines' quality is different
3. The proportion of acid to chlorides affects quality
4. Density affects the quality of wine 


Data dictionary
'color': white = 0, red = 1
